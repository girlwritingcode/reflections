\f1\fs26 \cf0 1. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?\
   It was easy just to check the lines with pluses and minuses instead of looking at all the code.\
\
2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer\
   in the long term?\
   If you need to go back and make changes (after breaking some code) it\'92s easy to see what was working.\
   Also, it\'92s sometimes necessary to trace how a particular piece of code or feature came about.\
\
3. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in\
   Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?\
   It\'92s possible that you\'92d forget to save the file or save so infrequently, that iterations of the file\
   are frequently lost.\
\
4. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit,\
   while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?\
   Git needs to save multiple files because there are many files that make up a website. Google Docs is\
   usually used for text files or spreadsheets which operate independently.\
\
5. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?\
   \'91git log\'92 lists out all the changes that were made along with their times and dates. \'91git diff\'92 will\
   show where there are differences between two files. Don\'92t forget to scroll down!\
\
6. How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?\
   Knowing that you can reverse the changes, makes me more likely to make changes! Now that you have your\
   workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for? I guess I\'92ll use it when I build my pages for\
   Intro to HTML and CSS. :)\
