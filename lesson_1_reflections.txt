1. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
   It was easy just to check the lines with pluses and minuses instead of looking at all the code.

2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer
   in the long term?
   If you need to go back and make changes (after breaking some code) it’s easy to see what was working.
   Also, it’s sometimes necessary to trace how a particular piece of code or feature came about.

3. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in
   Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
   It’s possible that you’d forget to save the file or save so infrequently, that iterations of the file
   are frequently lost.

4. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit,
   while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
   Git needs to save multiple files because there are many files that make up a website. Google Docs is
   usually used for text files or spreadsheets which operate independently.

5. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
   ‘git log’ lists out all the changes that were made along with their times and dates. ‘git diff’ will
   show where there are differences between two files. Don’t forget to scroll down!

6. How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
   Knowing that you can reverse the changes, makes me more likely to make changes! Now that you have your
   workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for? I guess I’ll use it when I build my pages for
   Intro to HTML and CSS. :)
