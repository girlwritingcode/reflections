1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
   your work local?
   Any time you think you might want a backup of your files and/or when
   working with someone else on a project.
   
2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
   Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
   It's better to decide when to pull since you may be working on changes
   that could be interrupted by older/newer code from a remote repository.
